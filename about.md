### Manifesto

ðŸ¤© Every holder have a right to know whether project he's participating in is a scam or not. **SCAM** token answers this question right away with its name saving you hours of googling and researching.

ðŸ¤© We plan to **announce dates for the rugpull** or pump'n'dump events beforehand, so you can sell early without loosing your money. Transparency and honesty should be a foundation for our token.

ðŸ¤© We are completely **anonymous team** doing development from stolen accounts purchased on darknet. This allows us to leave no traces when we run off with the money.

### Tokenomics

We have total supply of **1 000 000 000 000** SCAM tokens and 49% percent of the emission most likely are going to be used for the proper **rug pull**.

While we have clear intentions to **scam** all token holders, you can still try your luck and buy the token.
